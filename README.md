# LoxPlusPlus

This is a bytecode compiler for the Lox programming language from the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The original
implementation from the book uses C99, but I'm using mostly C-style C++ for this
project. Vectors and maps make things so much easier.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run

    make

The build artifacts will be in the `build` directory.

## Usage

The executable is called `loxpp` and it's in the project's root directory.
